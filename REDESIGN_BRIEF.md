# Pickle Advisors Website Redesign Brief

## About the Business
- Pickle Advisors LLC - VC advisory firm focused on CPG and consumer culture brands
- Founded by Jonathan Deeter, based in Brooklyn NY
- Advisory clients are CPG founders - pricing, strategy, fundraising
- He built AI-powered dashboards for investment funds managing over 1 billion dollars, now applying that same tooling to CPG brands
- Content brand: Deets Eats Media (@deetseatsnyc) - discovering emerging food brands, generating deal flow
- Newsletter: The Deeter Digest on Substack
- Podcast: Unpackaged Goods (NOT Preserved Stories - that is the OLD name, remove ALL references to Preserved Stories)
- The number 1 CTA is BOOK A CALL - use mailto:jonathan@pickleadvisors.com

## Brand System
- Colors: keep green #00C851 as primary for Pickle Advisors, pink #FFB6C1 as accent
- Clean, modern, confident - not playful or cutesy
- The current site is way too wordy and repetitive. Cut the fluff. Be direct.
- The smiley D mascot SVG is already in the codebase, keep using it for the Deets Eats section

## Key Sections (in order)
1. Hero - We help CPG founders raise money, fix pricing, and build AI-powered operations. CTA: Book a Call
2. What We Do - 3 clear services: Advisory (strategy, pricing, fundraising), AI-Powered Brand OS (dashboards, financial modeling, automated alerts - this is the differentiator), Media and Distribution (content, exposure through Deets Eats)
3. About Jonathan - brief, credible. 10+ years in startups and fintech, built AI tools for billion dollar funds, now applying to CPG. Photo placeholder.
4. Deets Eats Media - brief section. Newsletter (Deeter Digest), Podcast (Unpackaged Goods), Social content. Links to Instagram, TikTok, Substack.
5. Contact - Book a call CTA. mailto:jonathan@pickleadvisors.com. Keep it simple.

## Design Principles
- Less is more. The current site has like 12 sections saying the same thing. Cut it to 5.
- No filler stats (Real, Honest, Growing are not stats)
- No repeated eyes light up copy
- Professional but warm. This is a business site, not a Canva template.
- Mobile-first responsive
- Keep the existing logo SVG from nav
- Smooth scroll, subtle animations only
- Single HTML file, no external dependencies except Google Fonts
- DO NOT use Preserved Stories anywhere. The podcast is called Unpackaged Goods.
- DO NOT be wordy. Every sentence should earn its place.
